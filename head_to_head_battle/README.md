# AWS DeepComposer: Train it Again Maestro

This web series from [A Cloud Guru](https://acloud.guru) teaches you machine learning using [AWS DeepComposer](https://aws.amazon.com/deepcomposer/).
AWS DeepComposer is an educational AWS service and musical keyboard that uses Generative AI to transform a melody that you provide into a completely original song. 


## Episode 6 - Head-to-Head Battle

During this last episode, you learn to upload your musical creation to SoundCloud and we wrap up by putting everything we've learned to use during the head-to-head battle. During the battle, we build a custom GAN architecture and train a music genre model using Amazon SageMaker. In this example, we train a hip hop/rap genre model and use it to generate a brand new song.
