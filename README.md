# AWS DeepComposer: Train it Again Maestro

This web series from [A Cloud Guru](https://acloud.guru) teaches you machine learning using [AWS DeepComposer](https://aws.amazon.com/deepcomposer/).
AWS DeepComposer is an educational AWS service and musical keyboard that uses Generative AI to transform a melody that you provide into a completely original song. 


## Episode 4 - Music Composition with a Custom Model

During this episode, you learn to build a custom GAN architecture and train a music genre model using Amazon SageMaker. In this example, we will train a reggae genre model and use it to generate a brand new song.
